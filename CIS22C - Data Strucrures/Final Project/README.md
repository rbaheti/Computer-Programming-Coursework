Final Project

Question:  
Create a database to store music records. Each music record stores name of song, name of artist, name of record label, genre and year of release. Use 2 binary trees and a HashTable to store the record objects. One binary tree should compare records using song name (primary key), another binary tree should compare records using artist name (secondary key). HashTable should use song name as key. Use the 3 data structures to efficiently perform the following operations on the database:  
1. Print all music records sorted by song name.  
2. Print all music records sorted by artist name.  
3. Search a music record using song name.  
4. Search a music record using artist name.  
5. Add a new music record to the database.
6. Delete a new music record from the database.
7. Write the database to a file on disk.
