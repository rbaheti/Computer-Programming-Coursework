    <h1>Top Secrets For Long, Thick and Shiny Hair</h1>
    <h2 style="color:green">  - By Mahek Sood </h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    Most of us think that long and lustrous hair is hereditary, i.e., if their previous generations have had thick, long and shiny hair, it can be passed through genes to future generations.  I won’t say that it is a myth, but I won’t even say that it is completely true.  Hair if given a little extra care along with better diet, and right handling and maintenance, can give you amazing results. They can grow long, thick and shiny if the following tips are followed.
  </p>
 
  <h3 style="color:blue">
    1. Oil your hair once a week with castor, almond, and olive oil.
  </h3>
  <p>
    Castor, almond and olive oil are best food for hair. Castor is good for re-growth of hair, almonds oil has vitamin E which nourishes the hair and gives sheen to it and olive gives body and volume to hair and helps it grow faster.
  </p>
  
  <h4 style="color:orange"> How To Do: </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Take 2 tablespoons of olive oil and microwave it for 15 seconds.</li>
    <li>Add 2 tablespoons of castor oil and 1 tablespoon of almond oil.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Apply the above mixture into the roots and tip of hair and massage it so it penetrates into your scalp and leave it overnight, wash it the next morning. You will see the results after a month, continue it for 6 months for better results.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong> Note: </strong> If you have oily hair, do not leave the oil overnight, apply for 2 – 3 hours and wash it.
  </p>
  
  <h3 style="color:blue"> 2. Shampoo on MWF: </h3>
  <p>
    Make a point to shampoo your hair thrice a week – on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Choose a shampoo suitable for the hair type.  Dry/oily/combination (dry scalp and oily roots/oily scalp and dry roots).  
  </p>
  
  <h3 style="color:blue">
    3. Wash your hair with milk:
  </h3>
  <p>
    No, it is not smelly at all. Make a point not to wash your hair without a hair mask. In today’s fast-moving life, most of us do not have the time to put hair mask on every alternate day, therefore the best and easy way is to apply milk.  Milk moisturises your hair, adds shine and helps to grow the hair long.
  </p>
  
  <h4 style="color:orange"> How To Do: </h4>
  <p>
    Take half a bowl of milk on a shampoo day, dip your fingers and take some milk in your palm and apply it into the scalp. Leave it for a few minutes.  Shampoo it well after a few minutes.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong> Note: </strong> It will show results within a month. If you have curly hair, it will open up the curls and make it manageable in case hair is frizzy. If you think it gets too oily, then make it once or twice a week.
  </p>
  
  <h3 style="color:blue">
    4. Avoid Using Hair Dryers After Shampooing:
  </h3>
  <p>
    After shampoo, wrap your hair in the towel for some time (2-3 minutes) so that hair do not remain dripping wet. Then, vigorously massage your scalp with fingers to dry your hair.  This will improve the blood circulation of the scalp which further will enhance hair growth and prevent hair fall.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong> Note: </strong> Be a little careful while massaging the scalp, else the fingers will get tangled in the hair.
  </p>
  
  <h3 style="color:blue"> 5.  Curd and Honey: </h3>
  <p>
    Curd and honey prevents hair loss, this hair mask can be used by all hair types once in a fortnight. Curd being good in magnesium and potassium, it prevents hair fall and honey adds lustre to hair.
  </p>
  
  <h4 style="color:orange"> How To Do: </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Take 4 tablespoons of curd.</li>
    <li>Add 1 tablespoon of honey.</li>
    <li>Mix it well and apply for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Shampoo your hair and see the result.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong> Note: </strong> This mask can be used by all hair types – oily and dry.
  </p>
  
  <h3 style="color:blue"> 6.  Drink Milk with Almond Oil: </h3>
  <p>
    Milk is full of proteins and a complete diet in itself and combined with almond oil which provides vitamin E, it is a complete food for hair and skin. Make a point to have a cup of warm milk with a teaspoon of almond oil before going to bed.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong> Note: </strong>   Avoid milk in case of allergy.
