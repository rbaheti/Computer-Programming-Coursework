  <p> With over 500 languages and 6,000 dialects, the diverse cultures and religions of India shape today’s wedding ceremonies, and so Indian weddings vary based on their region of origin. Many different rituals that are part of an Indian wedding ceremony also can take place over several days.</p>
  
<p> Let me give you overall idea of a Hindu marriage. Some of the ceremonies are described briefly below:</p>

<h3>1. Ring Ceremony (Engagement)</h3>
<p>First comes the Ring ceremony, also known as Engagement. The engagement is the first agreement between the families, and that's when they set the wedding date. </p>

  <h3>2. Mehendi (Henna) Ceremony</h3>
    <p>The Mehendi Ceremony generally takes place the day before the wedding, in the morning. The bride and the groom’s family observe this ritual separately at their own residences. It is traditionally a women centric ceremony with the men of the family generally not participating. Henna designs are more elaborate and depending on what the bride prefers, the henna is applied on the front and back of her palm, forearm, and on the feet till below the knee. Elderly ladies sing traditional Mehendi songs with dholaks and other musical instruments. Women relatives of the bride also get Mehendi applied to their hands, although the designs are not as elaborate as the bridal Mehendi.</p>

    <h3>3. Haldi (Turmeric) Ceremony</h3>
    <p> The haldi ceremony is the one in which a paste of turmeric is applied on the bride and the groom’s body before their wedding. Traditionally, people make a paste using haldi and different ingredients according to their individual family customs. While some mix it with sandalwood powder and milk, others mix it with rose water. This paste is then applied on the bride and the groom’s face, neck, hands and feet, by their near and dear ones. This ceremony is also accompanied by traditional songs and dances at times.</p>

  <h3>4. Sangeet (Dance and music) Ceremony</h3>
    <p> One of the most talked about pre-wedding events, the Sangeet, is a celebration of coming together of the two families in the union of their children. The ceremony offers respite from all the hectic seriousness of the wedding preparations. There would be dancing with the women of the household dancing away along with the bride participating with gusto. Previously, it used to last for a few days, but nowadays its mostly one day, and sometimes one evening. </p>

  <h3>5. Phere (walk around the fire) Ceremony</h3>
    <p>The bride and the groom go around the holy wedding pyre 7 times. For the first three rounds or ‘pheras’, the bride leads and in the next four, the groom leads. With each round, the would-be couple takes a solemn marriage vow which they are expected to fulfill for the rest of their lives. This is a Vedic ritual. After this ceremony, the bride and the groom are considered husband and wife. </p>

    <h3>6. Bidaai (Daughter parting from her family) Ceremony</h3>
    <p>It's all Fun and Laughter for the family and friends till the Wedding Day finally arrives. Days prior to the wedding are filled with joy, humour singing and dancing and mixed emotions for all. And then comes the 'Bidaai', the time for the bride to officially leave her place of birth, her home, her loved ones and go to a new home and life that awaits her. In a traditional Bidaai ceremony, the bride is taken to her home after the pheras and kanyadaan where she is accompanied by her close family and friends. With a very heavy heart, she hugs all her loved ones and bids a final farewell as they cry with mixed emotions of giving her away and at the same time blessing her a happy married life.</p>

    <h3>Finally, about the food!</h3>
    <p>
      When it comes to weddings, food is the essence of Hindu celebrations. If you’ve ever had the chance to attend an Indian wedding you’ll know that there’s no party without a huge amount of colorful and expensive dishes. In Indian culture, weddings are the perfect opportunity to show off your cooking skills and spread the love through food. Indian cuisine offers many different flavours and can match virtually any food taste. You just need to taste them and find your favorites one. After all, it will take you time to get through that seemingly endless table!</p>
