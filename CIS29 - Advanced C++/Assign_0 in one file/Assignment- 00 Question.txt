Purpose:  Design a program using Object Oriented Design Techniques.

Create a console application to convert US Measurement System to Metric Units and Metric Units to US Measurement System, for the following:

• Distance
• Weight
• Volume

Before starting to code, submit within 5 days a UML Class Diagram of your proposed solution.  See the video Tutorial on producing a UML diagram if you haven't used UML before.  Design your program from a data-centric (Object Oriented Design), rather than code-centric (procedural) perspective. 

First, your program should prompt the user for input, compute the conversions and output the results.

Notes: 

Distance
1 inch = 2.54 centimeters
1 foot = 12 inches
1 mile = 5280 feet
1 centimeter = 1 / 2.54 inches
1 meter = 100 centimeters
1 kilometer = 1000 meters

Weight
1 ounce = 28.375 grams
1 pound = 16 ounces
1 gram = 1 / 28.375 ounces
1 kilogram = 1000 grams

Volume
1 ounce = 29.57353 milliliters
1 gallon = 128 ounces
1 milliliter = 1 / 29.57353 ounces
1 liter = 1000 milliliters
