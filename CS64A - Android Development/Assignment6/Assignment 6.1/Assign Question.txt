Follow the slides and tutorial this week to apply style and theme to your application:

First, create an application which has three activities: MainActivity.java, secondActivity.java, and ThirdActivity.java. On the UI of MainACtivity, there are two buttons: one has text "Open Second", which when clicked, will launch the SecondActivity. Another button has text "Open third", which when cliked, will launch ThirdActivity. 

Add your own widgets to the SecondActivity and ThirdActivity UI. It is required that each activity has a different theme. Each activity should have a "Quit" button which will stop the current activity.

Add a title string which contains your name, for example "Hello, [your name]" to each activity using TextView

Apply styles and theme to view components, each individual activity and application
