In this lab, we are going to create thread by implementing the Runnable interface

Step 1: Create a JAVA project ThreadPrint

Step 2: implement the Runnable Interface and create a class called PrintMessage. Here are some description of the Message class:

It has a data field of type String called name

It has another data field of type String called message

It has a constructor which takes two String parameters and assign them to field  name and field message.

It overrides the run() method. Inside the run() method, it will repeatedly print out String “[name] says [message]”  5 times. (see the sample output below)

Step 3:

Create a ThreadTest class which contains a main() method. In the main() method, create three different threads. Name them separately as “one”, “two”, and “Three”. For thread “one”, pass your first name as message; for thread “two”, pass your last name as message; for thread “three”, pass your ID as message.

Start the three threads.

Step 4: run the Java program and look at the output. Run the program multiple times and see if the output are different.

[Sample output]
one says John
three says 1234567
two says Smith
three says 1234567
one says John
three says 1234567
two says Smith
two says Smith
two says Smith
two says Smith
three says 1234567
one says John
one says John
one says John
three says 1234567
