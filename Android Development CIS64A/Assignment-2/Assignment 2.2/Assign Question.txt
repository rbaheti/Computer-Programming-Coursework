Object oriented programming exercise

Start a new Java project called StudentsRecordApp

 

Navigate down to /src and create the following interface and classes:

 

Interface CourseManager: Add a new Interface called CourseManager

Interface has two abstract methods:

public void addCourse();

public void dropCourse();

 

Class Student: add a class Student and Insert fields following

   String id;

   String name;

   int units;

   float grades[];

public methods:

    setters and getters for the data fields.
    public method printInfo which prints out the data field values in a user friendly string.

 

Class RegisteredStudent: add a class RegisteredStudent which inherits from Student class and and interface CourseManager.  Provide implementation to the abstract methods to do the following:

//invoking methods “addCourse” will increase units by 2

   //invoking methods “dropCourse” will decrease units by 2

Make sure to add logic to do unit range validation check, i.e., units value can only be a positive integer, and maximum units cannot exceed 200.

 

Class CSMajorStudent: add a class CSMajorStudent which inherits from RegisteredStudent class and interface CourseManager.  

    Add a data field String major and set it to "CS".
    Override method printInfo to print out all data fields values, including major
    Provide implementation to the abstract methods to do the following:

   //invoking methods “addCourse” will increase units by 4

   //invoking methods “dropCourse” will decrease units by 4

Make sure to add logic to do unit range validation check, i.e., units value can only be a positive integer, and maximum units cannot exceed 200.

 

Main class: In your main class, implement the main method and meet the following requirements:

Public static void main(String[] args){

// create a RegisteredStudent object John

// set John’s name to “John Smith”

//set John's id to "0001"

// set John’s units to 12

// set John’s grades to {75, 95, 86, 91, 67, 100}

// print John’s information using printInfo()

// calculate the average grade for John

//in another line print out John’s name and average grade

//John adds three courses  (each time a course is added the units will be increased by 2)

//John drops one course (each time a course is dropped the units will be decreased by 2)

//in a new line print out John’s information

//--------Second object--------------

// create a CSMajorStudent object Mary

// set Mary’s name to “Mary Lee”

//set Mary's id to "0002"

// set Mary’s units to 16

 // Set Mary’s grades to {81, 93, 79, 90}

//Mary adds three courses  (each time a course is added the units will be increased by 4)

//Mary drops one course (each time a course is dropped the units will be decreased by 4)

//in a new line print out Mary’s name and her total units

 

}

 

Run you java project (NOT as Android application) and capture the console output

[Checkpoint]

    Put all your java class definition in one file. Submit your code in text format.
    Capture the screen shot of your program and console output to and as save as an image file.
    Submit the code text file and screen capture image file as attachments for this lab
