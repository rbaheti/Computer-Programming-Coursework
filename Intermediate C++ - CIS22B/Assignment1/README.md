Assignment 1

Question:  
1. Read in the contents of a text file up to a maximum of 1024 words.  When reading the file contents, you can discard words that are single characters to avoid symbols, special characters etc.  
2. Sort the words read in ascending order in an array using the Selection Sort algorithm implemented in its own function.  
3. Search any item input by user in your sorted list using the Binary Search algorithm implemented in its own function.  
4. Use string comparisons as taught in CIS 22A for comparing/ordering words, i.e. words starting with numbers sort lower than words starting with uppercase letters which are lower than words starting with lowercase letters. If a word appears twice using exactly the same case, it can be stored twice side-by-side in the array and either index can be returned in the search.
