Here's the instruction for IntentActivity:

In your application, create two activities MainActivity.java and secondActivity.java with separate UI. The UI of MainActivity.java shows a text message saying "Hello " and your first and last name, and two buttons vertically. 

One button has text “OPEN Second”. When you click the button, it will start the secondActivity, which is a simple UI with a text message saying "Hello " and your first and last name, and a "back" button which stops the activity and goes back to the calling activity. One button with text “OPEN SEARCH”, when you click this button, it will open webpage http:// (Links to an external site.)www.google.com (Links to an external site.). 

Here's the code you can use to open a webpage with intent:
Intent myIntent = new Intent();
myIntent.setAction(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);
myIntent.setData(Uri.parse("http://www.google.com"));
startActivity(myIntent);
[Checkpoint]
