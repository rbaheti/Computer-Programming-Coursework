Assignment 6

Question:  
A prime number is an integer that is divisible only by 1 and by itself. Write a program that:
1. Takes a number as an input.  
2. Prints back to the console all the primes that are larger than 1  but not larger than the number that has been entered.  

You need to have a procedure called isPrime.  
1. This procedure receives a number through one of the registers.  
2. Check if this number is prime.  
3. Returns back to the main program 1, if the number is prime, 0 otherwise, through one of registers.
