4. Ask the user to enter the elements inside the array.  
5. Ask the user for the row index and display the sum of the selected row.  
6. It must have a procedure that calculates the sum of one row in the two-dimensional array of bytes, words, or doublewords.  
7. For the parameters and the return value use the stack.
