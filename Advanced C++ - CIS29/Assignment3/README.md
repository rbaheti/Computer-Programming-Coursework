Assignment 3

Question:  
The purpose of this assignment is to overload dynamic memory operators and track memory usage using a custom memory manager.  
1. Overload operator new (scalar) and new[] (vector).  
2. Overload operator delete (scalar) and delete[] (vector).  
3. Write a class to monitor NEW and DELETE usage.  
4. Incorporate your overloaded NEW and DELETE into a standard C++ program to monitor NEW and DELETE usage. The purpose is to determine if there are any memory leaks in a C++ program that uses NEW and DELETE.
